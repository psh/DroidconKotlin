But they are not the only tool we got to test the UI:\r\nsnapshot tests are some specific type of UI tests, that are not only easier to write but also run much faster than standard UI tests. They even help detect visual regression bugs that Espresso/UiAutomator tests cannot. Indeed, they are more widely used than UI tests by big companies such as Airbnb, with ≈ 30.000 snapshot tests, and Uber, with thousand of snapshot tests vs. a handful of UI tests, among others.\r\n\r\nWhile there are plenty of resources about writing UI tests on Android, the same doesn't exist for snapshot tests. There is no guidance.\r\n\r\nSo, what is actually snapshot testing? how do you write a valuable snapshot test? what are the best practices? what are the pitfalls you have to take into account?\r\n\r\nIf you want to know how to get the most out of snapshot testing, come and join this tech talk. You will learn:\r\n- what is snapshot testing and how your app can benefit from it\r\n- how to decide what to snapshot test\r\n- how to write your first meaningful snapshot test\r\n- tips and tricks for better snapshot testing and what pitfalls to avoid\u2028",

While Kotlin and Swift are syntactically very similar, they solve certain problems in very different ways. For example, a Swift developer often uses a struct where a Kotlin developer uses a data class. This means the default ways that things translate from Kotlin through Objective-C into Swift don’t always come out looking idiomatic\r\n\r\nWe’ll talk through some of these differences, and strategies for dealing with them. Kotlin, Objective-C, and Swift are three different languages, and so we shouldn’t expect to be able to translate between them perfectly. But with a bit of care at the interop layer, we can make things a lot smoother in the iOS code.",

            "description": "This talk is a deep-dive into WorkManager's implementation details by breaking down the following important abstractions:\r\n\r\n* Schedulers\r\nWorkManager supports multiple schedulers. The same WorkRequest might get picked up and executed by a combination of the AlarmManager based implementation, JobScheduler or the in-process scheduler. We will understand important concurrency primitives being used in the implementation that allows WorkManager to reconcile and manage state across several subsystems in the Android framework. We will also talk about how the dreaded 100 jobs limit affects the abstraction, and how WorkManager works around this limitation, while being fair to WorkRequests being executed.\r\n\r\n* Processer and WorkerWrapper\r\nThis will tie-in to the previous discussion around Schedulers, by introducing the audience to the component that orchestrates all the work, the Processor. We will discuss, why the Processor as a primitive is very important and how Workers are actually executed by an aptly named WorkerWrapper.\r\n\r\n* AlarmManager based implementation and Constraint Trackers\r\nNow that we have enough context, we can finally talk about how the AlarmManager based implementation in WorkManager works. We will also look at how WorkManager tracks constraints for WorkRequests and how it affects the state machine of the WorkRequest itself.\r\n\r\n* Long Running work\r\nIn the final section of the talk, we will talk about how WorkManager executes important long running foreground work, while tracking constraints and also attributing that work so that JobScheduler can be fairer across multiple applications. We will also talk about foreground service restrictions in Android 12, and expedited work requests.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhy this talk ?\r\nThis talk arguably dives deep into implementation details that might change in the future as the design of WorkManager evolves. However, one of the main takeaways for the talk will be that WorkManager is not this magical black box. It will also give the audience real examples on how they can build components that solve similarly hard-problems when they encounter them on their own. Finally, one of the other goals for this talk is to highlight some of the learnings I had while building WorkManager.",

            "description": "ProGuard has been the industry standard for obfuscating, shrinking and optimizing Java & Android apps for close to 20 years. ProGuard, and the compatible R8 shrinker, usually need some configuration since it's not always technically possible to determine which entities should be processed. The configuration for these tools is based on `-keep` rules that use a Java-like template syntax.\r\n\r\nNow that Kotlin is the preferred language for Android development, using `-keep` rules can be tricky since the Kotlin code strays further from the Java-like template syntax. Kotlin also presents an additional problem: Kotlin-specific features are embedded in metadata stored as annotations to Java classes. This metadata must be kept and adapted appropriately when using reflection or Kotlin-specific features.\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways: \r\n\r\n1. We’ll show how to determine `-keep` rules for Kotlin apps & libraries through various examples with the help of the ProGuard Playground (http://playground.proguard.com)\r\n2. We’ll describe how ProGuard (and R8) can process Kotlin metadata to support Kotlin specific features.\r\n3. We’ll also clear up any confusion about R8 replacing ProGuard as the new default shrinker for Android and what this means for ProGuard",

            "description": "What can aviation teach us about software? More acutely, what can aviation disasters teach us? Aviation is an industry that has committed to relentlessly learning from its mistakes, in the name of making the skies safer. Where the cost of the next iteration is potentially counted in human lives, then that relentlessness is not seen as a noble commitment but rather as the bare minimum. As software professionals, we have it easy. The costs of our decisions and failures are far far lower. For now.\r\n\r\nAs software permeates ever wider through our lives, the cost of failure gets higher. Societies are becoming cashless, and doctors are carrying a different kind of tablet. Smart phones have led us to smart homes. In a world where everything is connected, it’s time to learn from the industries where disasters are avoided at all costs. And in the face of disaster, instinctively running toward scrutiny rather than away from it.\r\n\r\nThis talk is not doom and gloom. It is a practical look at the methods and insights that almost 100 years of investigating commercial aviation disasters can teach us as software engineers.",

However, there are challenges in having a growing number of flavors. There's an impact on build speeds, feature development and test coverage. \r\n\r\nThe talk will cover how Android's build system and Gradle can help us in automating product flavors management and manage which build flavor & build type Android studio is working on.\r\n\r\nWe will also discuss why unit tests are not enough to guarantee that an app will behave the same for different clients then we will go through how snapshot testing and Espresso helped us detect undesired behavioural changes.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will cover the importance of having a solid feature flagging strategy to avoid breaking between flavors.",

This means the default ways that things translate from Kotlin through Objective-C into Swift don’t always come out looking idiomatic\r\n\r\nWe’ll talk through some of these differences, and strategies for dealing with them. Kotlin, Objective-C, and Swift are three different languages, and so we shouldn’t expect to be able to translate between them perfectly. But with a bit of care at the interop layer, we can make things a lot smoother in the iOS code.",

              "description": "One of the most powerful software quality tools are code reviews - an activity in which a developer, other than the author, examines a software deliverable for defects, and improvement opportunities. For a new Engineer, a code review can be a valuable learning resource, and for a more experienced Engineer it can be a good teaching mechanism when done properly. Whether you are a fresh college graduate, or a Senior Engineer with multiple years of experience under your belt, this talk will take you on the journey of a team that transformed their code review process from being vague and lacking, to being the biggest investment of their resulting, high quality code output. By the end of this talk your perspective on code reviews should change and you will approach code reviews as what they really are - a Software Engineer's Best Friend (woof! woof!)",

They even help detect visual regression bugs that Espresso/UiAutomator tests cannot. Indeed, they are more widely used than UI tests by big companies such as Airbnb, with ≈ 30.000 snapshot tests, and Uber, with thousand of snapshot tests vs. a handful of UI tests, among others.\r\n\r\nWhile there are plenty of resources about writing UI tests on Android, the same doesn't exist for snapshot tests. There is no guidance.\r\n\r\nSo, what is actually snapshot testing? how do you write a valuable snapshot test? what are the best practices? what are the pitfalls you have to take into account?\r\n\r\nIf you want to know how to get the most out of snapshot testing, come and join this tech talk.

              "description": "This talk is a deep-dive into WorkManager's implementation details by breaking down the following important abstractions:\r\n\r\n* Schedulers\r\nWorkManager supports multiple schedulers. The same WorkRequest might get picked up and executed by a combination of the AlarmManager based implementation, JobScheduler or the in-process scheduler. We will understand important concurrency primitives being used in the implementation that allows WorkManager to reconcile and manage state across several subsystems in the Android framework. We will also talk about how the dreaded 100 jobs limit affects the abstraction, and how WorkManager works around this limitation, while being fair to WorkRequests being executed.\r\n\r\n* Processer and WorkerWrapper\r\nThis will tie-in to the previous discussion around Schedulers, by introducing the audience to the component that orchestrates all the work, the Processor. We will discuss, why the Processor as a primitive is very important and how Workers are actually executed by an aptly named WorkerWrapper.\r\n\r\n* AlarmManager based implementation and Constraint Trackers\r\nNow that we have enough context, we can finally talk about how the AlarmManager based implementation in WorkManager works. We will also look at how WorkManager tracks constraints for WorkRequests and how it affects the state machine of the WorkRequest itself.\r\n\r\n* Long Running work\r\nIn the final section of the talk, we will talk about how WorkManager executes important long running foreground work, while tracking constraints and also attributing that work so that JobScheduler can be fairer across multiple applications. We will also talk about foreground service restrictions in Android 12, and expedited work requests.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhy this talk ?\r\nThis talk arguably dives deep into implementation details that might change in the future as the design of WorkManager evolves. However, one of the main takeaways for the talk will be that WorkManager is not this magical black box. It will also give the audience real examples on how they can build components that solve similarly hard-problems when they encounter them on their own. Finally, one of the other goals for this talk is to highlight some of the learnings I had while building WorkManager.",

Swing is an old tech that’s impervious to newcomers and full of gotchas; JavaFx and TornadoFX aren’t much better; and using frameworks like Qt from Kotlin is going to take a toll on your mental wellbeing.\r\n\r\nOr at least, this used to be the case!\r\n\r\nWe’ll see how, with Compose for Desktop, you can take much of your existing UI skill set from Jetpack Compose and apply it to create tools that run on desktop computers. There are some gotchas and some differences to be aware of, and this talk will cover them pointing out what is and isn’t there yet in Compose for Desktop.",

              "description": "ProGuard has been the industry standard for obfuscating, shrinking and optimizing Java & Android apps for close to 20 years. ProGuard, and the compatible R8 shrinker, usually need some configuration since it's not always technically possible to determine which entities should be processed. The configuration for these tools is based on `-keep` rules that use a Java-like template syntax.\r\n\r\nNow that Kotlin is the preferred language for Android development, using `-keep` rules can be tricky since the Kotlin code strays further from the Java-like template syntax. Kotlin also presents an additional problem: Kotlin-specific features are embedded in metadata stored as annotations to Java classes. This metadata must be kept and adapted appropriately when using reflection or Kotlin-specific features.\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways: \r\n\r\n1. We’ll show how to determine `-keep` rules for Kotlin apps & libraries through various examples with the help of the ProGuard Playground (http://playground.proguard.com)\r\n2. We’ll describe how ProGuard (and R8) can process Kotlin metadata to support Kotlin specific features.\r\n3. We’ll also clear up any confusion about R8 replacing ProGuard as the new default shrinker for Android and what this means for ProGuard",

Aviation is an industry that has committed to relentlessly learning from its mistakes, in the name of making the skies safer. Where the cost of the next iteration is potentially counted in human lives, then that relentlessness is not seen as a noble commitment but rather as the bare minimum. As software professionals, we have it easy. The costs of our decisions and failures are far far lower. For now.\r\n\r\nAs software permeates ever wider through our lives, the cost of failure gets higher. Societies are becoming cashless, and doctors are carrying a different kind of tablet. Smart phones have led us to smart homes. In a world where everything is connected, it’s time to learn from the industries where disasters are avoided at all costs. And in the face of disaster, instinctively running toward scrutiny rather than away from it.\r\n\r\nThis talk is not doom and gloom. It is a practical look at the methods and insights that almost 100 years of investigating commercial aviation disasters can teach us as software engineers.",

In this talk, we will take you along the journey of a Composable function, from being written, going through the unknown lands of the Kotlin and Compose compilers to being executed and displaying UI!  \r\n\r\nFrom Composables all the way down into the compiler plugins, we expose the metaprogramming responsible for all the \"magic\". Whether your interest is Jetpack Compose, compilers, or code transformations, this talk takes an otherwise complicated  topic and makes it digestible for everybody by diving into specific features offered by Compose.\r\n\r\nBy examining Compose's snapshot system,  you'll follow the compiler phases down to intercepting code transformations with IR. By recognizing the patterns that make it hard for Compose to generate efficient code, and this can help us to recognize patterns to use for performance.\r\n",

These measures can then be used to prioritize which parts to optimize first, as well as measure the performances gained (or lost) after a refactoring.\r\n\r\nBased on various concrete examples, this talk will focus on measuring Android code using the Jetpack Benchmark library, as well as exploring how Datadog’s Android SDK can help measure app performance in real life.",

We're told that code should document itself, but how do these design decisions reflect in the understanding of intended use?\r\n\r\nJust because we might not be exposing a module as a public or open-sourced library, doesn't mean we can't benefit from making good decisions towards an effective and sensible API. By taking the stance that every piece of code we write is an API we can build more versatile and scalable applications.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how you can apply best practices from the open-source world to your project, to guard implementations, provide concise and specific contracts, practical documentation mechanisms, and how doing so can aid (or harm) your build time.",

This means that if a user has a mobile app version with a bug, they’ll be stuck with that bug until a new version is released and they upgrade. As a result, the mobile app development life cycle is much less forgiving of bugs.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I will be talking about how to optimise Android app deployments from development to production including different and important tips and practices for developing, testing, releasing, and monitoring.

These measures can then be used to prioritize which parts to optimize first, as well as measure the performances gained (or lost) after a refactoring.\r\n\r\nBased on various concrete examples, this talk will focus on measuring Android code using the Jetpack Benchmark library, as well as exploring how Datadog’s Android SDK can help measure app performance in real life.",

              "description": "If you are an Android Developer, chances are you are pretty excited about Jetpack Compose! But how does it work? In this talk, we will take you along the journey of a Composable function, from being written, going through the unknown lands of the Kotlin and Compose compilers to being executed and displaying UI!  \r\n\r\nFrom Composables all the way down into the compiler plugins, we expose the metaprogramming responsible for all the \"magic\". Whether your interest is Jetpack Compose, compilers, or code transformations, this talk takes an otherwise complicated  topic and makes it digestible for everybody by diving into specific features offered by Compose.\r\n\r\nBy examining Compose's snapshot system,  you'll follow the compiler phases down to intercepting code transformations with IR. By recognizing the patterns that make it hard for Compose to generate efficient code, and this can help us to recognize patterns to use for performance.\r\n",

It becomes easy to forget that every decision you make will affect how it is used, or in the worst case, abused. We're told that code should document itself, but how do these design decisions reflect in the understanding of intended use?\r\n\r\nJust because we might not be exposing a module as a public or open-sourced library, doesn't mean we can't benefit from making good decisions towards an effective and sensible API. By taking the stance that every piece of code we write is an API we can build more versatile and scalable applications.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how you can apply best practices from the open-source world to your project, to guard implementations, provide concise and specific contracts, practical documentation mechanisms, and how doing so can aid (or harm) your build time.",

But now, App Actions, with the help of the Shortcuts framework, many build in intents and an improved testing tool have never been easier. In this talk we'll discover together why and how to voicify your app (and migrate from the actions.xml), how to test and finally how to publish your actions.",

This means that if a user has a mobile app version with a bug, they’ll be stuck with that bug until a new version is released and they upgrade. As a result, the mobile app development life cycle is much less forgiving of bugs.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I will be talking about how to optimise Android app deployments from development to production including different and important tips and practices for developing, testing, releasing, and monitoring.
