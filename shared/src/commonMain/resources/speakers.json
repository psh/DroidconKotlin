Typically, there's no public information about System Development, most of it is shared in internal vendor documentation. And I want to change that.

I saw the passion in developers' eyes when I showed them the new side of Android development. That gave me even more motivation to document what I do in everyday development and share it with others.\r\n\r\n",
